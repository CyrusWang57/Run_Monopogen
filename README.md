# Welcome to the practice of running Monopogen

Here are the notes documenting the actual process of running Monopogen.  
Full notes published in this website: [Run Monopogen](https://cyruswang57.github.io/Run_Monopogen/).

## Monopogen

[Monopogen](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01873-x) is an analysis package for SNV calling from single-cell sequencing, developed and maintained by Ken chen's lab in MDACC.

Source code of Monopogen can be found at [github.com/KChen-lab/Monopogen](https://github.com/KChen-lab/Monopogen/tree/main).

## Source data

In this note, the data used to run Monopogen is a single cell ATAC sequencing dataset from PBMC by 10X Multiome ([PBMC from a Healthy Donor](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/pbmc-from-a-healthy-donor-no-cell-sorting-3-k-1-standard-2-0-0)).
